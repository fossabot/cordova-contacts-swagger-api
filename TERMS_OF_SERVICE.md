## Ownership

As between You, Verizon, and its third party licensors and suppliers, Verizon or such third party licensors and suppliers are the sole owners of the OneAPI Site, including, without limitation, all copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property rights in the OneAPI Site, and any modifications, corrections or enhancements thereto.

## Use Restrictions

You agree to use the OneAPI Site for lawful purposes only. You must not (i) resell, sublicense, lease, assign, redistribute, transfer or otherwise make the OneAPI Site available to any third party; (ii) modify, copy, harvest, collect, or create derivative works based on the OneAPI Site; (iii) copy, frame or mirror any part or content of the OneAPI Site, other than copying or framing for Your own internal business purposes for use as permitted under this Site Use Agreement; (iv) reverse engineer the OneAPI Site; (v) attempt to gain unauthorized access to, or disrupt the integrity or performance of, the OneAPI Site, the Verizon network, or any service provided by or on behalf of Verizon, or any device connected to the Verizon network; (vi) send or store infringing or unlawful material using the OneAPI Site; (vii) impersonate someone else; (viii) access or use the OneAPI Site for the purpose of building a competitive product or service or for benchmarking, monitoring availability, comparative analysis or similar purposes; or (ix) remove, alter or destroy any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices displayed on the OneAPI Site.

You agree to use SMS APIs only in compliance with all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the Telephone Consumers Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), acceptable industry guidelines (including Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) Industry Best Practices and CTIA Best Practices and Successes, found here), Verizon’s Acceptable Use Policy, and this Site Use Agreement. You further agree that in connection with your use of SMS APIs: (a) You will not send messages containing executable files or links to other content or premium or similar messages that require a subscription or surcharge; (b) You will not install, deploy, or use any hardware, firmware, software or other technology or technique to circumvent Verizon's messaging network operations protections; and (c) You will not send any material or content in violation of the Acceptable Use provisions of the Verizon Terms of Use.

You may use SMS Services to send messages only to end users who have opted in to receive messages by (a) establishing an opt-in process that effectively captures each end user’s consent to receive messages, informs end users of the nature and scope of your messaging campaigns and any financial obligations (like “Standard Messaging Charges Apply”) associated with messaging; (b) immediately complying with end user opt-out requests such as STOP, END, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE or QUIT in compliance with industry guidelines; and (c) maintaining opt-in and opt-out records for each end user from the time that end user initiates opt-in until a minimum of six months after that end user has opted out. The foregoing requirements are in addition to requirements set forth by Verizon in the API documentation related to SMS APIs.

## Wireless Network Services SDK

The Wireless Network Services SDK consists of Web Services Description Language (“WSDL”) files, sample code, and HTML documentation containing graphical representations of the XML schemas for Verizon APIs (collectively, together with any other files made available as part of the download and any updates, supplements or support services related to the SDK, the “WNS SDK”). As used herein, “Wireless Network Services” means Verizon Wireless’ proprietary wireless services.

The WNS SDK must be used in conjunction with carrier-certified devices or modules that support WNS development and testing. Such devices and modules may be obtained from the manufacturers thereof. Use of such devices and modules is governed by their corresponding terms and conditions, not by this Site Use Agreement.

You may download, access and use the WNS SDK only for the purpose of designing, developing, testing or modifying applications (each a “WNS SDK-Based Application”) designed to operate with the Wireless Network Services (“Permitted Use”).

### Installation and Use
You may use the WNS SDK on an internal basis only on your devices and reproduce a reasonable number of copies of the WNS SDK, including the documentation, provided that you reproduce only complete copies, including, without limitation, all “read me” files, copyright notices, and other legal notices and terms that Verizon has included in the WNS SDK, and any such copy(ies) shall be only for your use for the Permitted Use and not that of any third party. You agree not to, and not to allow any third party to, reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or translate any software contained in the WNS SDK which is not provided by Verizon in source code format, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code thereof.

### Restrictions
You may not charge users of a WNS SDK-Based Application any fee to access or use the Wireless Network Services from within your WNS SDK-Based Application. You may not license, transfer, or assign any rights or grant any access to the WNS SDK to any third party, disclose the WNS SDK, or any part thereof, to any third party, or grant any access to the Wireless Network Services to any third party.

### Distributable Code
The WNS SDK contains code that you are permitted to include in WNS SDK-Based Applications subject to compliance with the terms below.

#### Right to Use and Distribute.
The sample code, demo program, WSDL files, and Verizon APIs are “Distributable Code” and are subject to the following:

##### Sample Code

You may modify, copy, and internally distribute the source code form of code marked as “reference implementation” in the WNS SDK.

##### Redistribution

You may permit distributors of WNS SDK-Based Applications to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of the WNS SDK-Based Applications.

#### Distribution Requirements

For any Distributable Code distributed as permitted herein, you must require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect Verizon at least as much as this Site Use Agreement and to indemnify Verizon for all costs (including costs of counsel) and to defend and hold Verizon harmless from and against all losses, claims, liabilities, damages or fees, including attorneys’ fees arising out of, resulting from, or relating to any claims related to the distribution or use of WNS SDK-Based Applications.

#### Distribution Restrictions
You may not: (i) alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code; (ii) use Verizon’s trademarks in the name or description of any WNS SDK-Based Application or in a way that suggests such application is a product or service of, or is endorsed by, Verizon; (iii) include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful applications; or (iv) modify, distribute or convey any Distributable Code so that the Distributable Code or any application to which it links, or of which it is a part, becomes subject to an Excluded License. An “Excluded License” is one that requires, as a condition of license, use, modification, distribution or conveyance, that the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form, that others have the right to modify or create derivative works of it, and/or that it becomes redistributable at no charge.

#### Internet-Based Services
Wireless Network Services may rely on internet-based communications which may change or be cancelled at any time. You may not use the WNS SDK or the Wireless Network Services in any way that could harm the Verizon Wireless Network or impair anyone else’s use of it. You may not use the WNS SDK or the Wireless Network Services to attempt to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.

## Miscellaneous

This Site Use Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and Verizon with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements and shall not be modified except by a signed amendment of both parties. The failure of either party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Site Use Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Each parent and affiliate of Verizon shall be third party beneficiaries to this Site Use Agreement and shall be entitled to enforce and rely upon any provision of this Site Use Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor) of them. Each party must comply with all applicable laws.
